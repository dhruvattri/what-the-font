                <p>Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed</p>
                <p>I'll make a cup of coffee for your head</p>
                <p>It'll get you up and going out of bed</p>
                <p>Yeah, I don't wanna fall asleep, I don't wanna pass away</p>
                <p>I been thinking of our future, 'cause I'll never see those days</p>
                <p>I don't know why this has happened, but I probably deserve it</p>
                <p>I tried to do my best, but you know that I'm not perfect</p>
                <p>I been praying for forgiveness, you've been praying for my health</p>
                <p>When I leave this Earth, hoping you'll find someone else</p>
                <p>'Cause, yeah, we still young, there's so much we haven't done</p>
                <p>Getting married, start a family, watch your husband with his son</p>
                <p>I wish it could be me, but I won't make it out this bed</p>
                <p>I hope I go to Heaven, so I see you once again</p>
                <p>My life was kinda short, but I got so many blessings</p>
                <p>Happy you were mine, it sucks that it's all ending</p>
                <p>Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed</p>
                <p>I'll make a cup of coffee for your head</p>
                <p>It'll get you up and going out of bed(yeah, ayy, ayy)</p>
                <p>Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed</p>
                <p>I'll make a cup of coffee for your head</p>
                <p>It'll get you up and going out of bed(ayy, yeah)</p>
                <p>I'm happy that you here with me, I'm sorry if I tear up</p>
                <p>When me and you were younger, you would always make me cheer up</p>
                <p>Taking goofy videos and walking through the park</p>
                <p>You would jump into my arms every time you heard a bark</p>
                <p>Cuddle in your sheets, sing me sound asleep</p>
                <p>And sneak out through your kitchen at exactly 1:03</p>
                <p>Sundays, went to church, on Mondays, watched a movie</p>
                <p>Soon you'll be alone, sorry that you have to lose me</p>
                <p>Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed</p>
                <p>I'll make a cup of coffee for your head</p>
                <p>It'll get you up and going out of bed</p>
                <p>Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed</p>
                <p>I'll make a cup of coffee for your head</p>
                <p>It'll get you up and going out of bed</p>
                <p>Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed</p>
                <p>I'll make a cup of coffee for your head</p>
                <p>It'll get you up and going out of bed</p>
                <p>Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed</p>
                <p>I'll make a cup of coffee for your head</p>
                <p>It'll get you up and going out of bed</p>
